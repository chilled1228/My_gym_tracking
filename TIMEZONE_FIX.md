# Timezone Fix for Vercel Deployment and Cross-Device Compatibility

## Problem

When deploying the application on Vercel, users encountered the error message "No meals found for this day". This issue was caused by timezone differences between the local development environment, the Vercel deployment environment, and various user devices.

## Root Cause

The root cause of this issue was that the application was using `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` to get the current date as a string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". However, this approach has several problems:

1. `toISOString()` always converts to UTC, which can be different from the user's local timezone
2. Different devices and browsers might handle dates differently
3. The server (Vercel) and client could be in completely different timezones

This meant that if a user created a meal plan for "today" using their local time on one device, but then accessed the application from Vercel on another device, the application might be looking for the meal plan on a different date.

## Solution

The solution was to implement device-adaptive, timezone-aware date handling functions that work consistently across all platforms and devices:

1. Created enhanced helper functions in `lib/utils.ts`:
   - `getLocalDateString(date)`: Converts a Date object to "YYYY-MM-DD" format using the client's local timezone with fallback mechanisms
   - `getTodayString()`: Gets today's date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format in the local timezone, consistently across devices
   - `dateFromLocalString(dateString)`: Converts a "YYYY-MM-DD" string to a Date object with robust error handling

2. Updated all instances of `date.toISOString().split('T')[0]` throughout the application to use these adaptive functions across all components

## Benefits

- **Device Adaptation**: Works consistently across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- **Browser Compatibility**: Handles timezone differences across different browsers
- **Environment Consistency**: Provides the same experience in development, staging, and production
- **Client-Side Reliability**: Uses the user's device timezone settings rather than the server's
- **Error Resilience**: Includes fallback mechanisms and error handling for edge cases

## Implementation Details

The enhanced implementation includes robust error handling and fallbacks:

```typescript
export function getLocalDateString(date: Date = new Date()): string {
  try {
    // Extract year, month, and day in user's local timezone
    const year = date.getFullYear();
    const month = String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
    const day = String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
    
    // Return YYYY-MM-DD format
    return `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback in case of any issues with the Date object
    console.error("Error formatting date:", error);
    // Return today's date as fallback using timezone offset
    const fallbackDate = new Date();
    const tzOffset = fallbackDate.getTimezoneOffset() * 60000;
    const localDate = new Date(fallbackDate.getTime() - tzOffset);
    return localDate.toISOString().split('T')[0];
  }
}
```

This ensures consistent date formatting based on the client's device timezone, with a fallback approach if there are any issues.

## Supported Use Cases

This device-adaptive fix ensures that:

1. When a user creates a diet or workout plan for "today" on their phone, they'll see the same plan when accessing from their desktop later that day
2. Progress tracking works correctly across different devices and date boundaries
3. Historical data is accessed consistently regardless of the device used
4. Users in different timezones all experience the application in their local time, not the server's time

## Testing

To test this fix:

1. Create a meal plan for "today" on one device (e.g., desktop browser)
2. Access the application on a different device (e.g., mobile phone)
3. Verify the meal plan for "today" appears correctly on both devices
4. Test with devices set to different timezones to ensure consistent behavior
5. Deploy to Vercel and verify the same consistent experience
